    spectrum_description: |
      Here you can see which Wi-Fi channel you are using on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands and how busy or quiet it is on all Wi-Fi channels. The available space on a channel depends on the channels used by Wi-Fi networks in your area and the channel you are using.

      You can manually choose a channel in Wi-Fi Signal, but this usually leads to poorer performance. For optimal performance, this setting is default set to Automatic.

      A Wi-Fi channel also uses space from adjacent Wi-Fi channels. In the spectrum analysis, you can see the overlap between the channels used by Wi-Fi networks in your area and the channels you are using.

      You can manually choose the bandwidth in Wi-Fi Signal, but this usually leads to poorer performance. For optimal performance, this setting is default set to Automatic.
